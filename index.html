      <h2>Section One</h2>
      <p>
        Human beings are part of nature. Nature is not dependent on human beings
        to exist. Human beings, on the other hand, are totally dependent on
        nature to exist. The growing number of people on the planet and how we
        live here is going to determine the future of nature. And the future of
        us. Nature will go on, no matter what. It will evolve. The question is,
        will it be with us or without us? If nature could talk, it would
        probably say it doesn’t much matter ​either way. We must understand
        there are aspects of how our planet evolves that are totally out of our
        control. But there are things that we can manage, control and do
        responsibly that will allow us and the planet to evolve together. We are
        Conservation International and we need your help. Our movement is
        dedicated to managing those we can control. Better. Country by country.
        Business by business. Human by human. We are not about us vs. them. It
        doesn’t matter if you’re an American, a Canadian, or a Papua New
        Guinean. You don’t even have to be particularly fond of the ocean or
        have a soft spot for elephants. This is simply about all of us coming
        together to do what needs to be done. Because if we don’t, nature will
        continue to evolve. Without us. Here’s to the future. With humans.

      <h2>Section Two</h2>
      <p>
        If not for nature then we wouldn’t be alive. The health benefits of
        nature for humans are incredible. The most important thing for survival
        given by nature is oxygen. The entire cycle of respiration is regulated
        by nature. The oxygen that we inhale is given by trees and the carbon
        dioxide we exhale is getting absorbed by trees. The ecosystem of nature
        is a community in which producers (plants), consumers, and decomposers
        work together in their environment for survival. The natural fundamental
        processes like soil creation, photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, and
        water cycling, allow Earth to sustain life. We are dependent on these
        ecosystem services daily whether or not we are aware. Nature provides us
        services round the clock: provisional services, regulating services, and
        non-material services. Provisional services include benefits extracted
        from nature such as food, water, natural fuels and fibres, and medicinal
        plants.

      <h2>Section Three</h2>
      <p>
        The natural cycle of our ecosystem is vital for the survival of
        organisms. We all should take care of all the components that make our
        nature complete. We should be sure not to pollute the water and air as
        they are gifts of Nature. Mother nature fosters us and never harms us.
        Those who live close to nature are observed to be enjoying a healthy and
        peaceful life in comparison to those who live in urban areas. Nature
        gives the sound of running fresh air which revives us, sweet sounds of
        birds that touch our ears, and sounds of breezing waves in the ocean
        makes us move within. All the great writers and poets have written about
        Mother Nature when they felt the exceptional beauty of nature or
        encountered any saddening scene of nature. Words Worth who was known as
        the poet of nature, has written many things in nature while being in
        close communion with nature and he has written many things about Nature.
